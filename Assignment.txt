1.)React is a Javascript Library which is intended for Frond End development of Web. React deals with working with components
 i.e. Everything in react is a component.

2.)The Features of react are Components,State,JSX, Virtual DOM

3.)JSX can be understood as combination of javascript and Html. It is optional for working in react projects. 
   Babel compiler is used for conversion of JSX to JS in our projects. 

4.)Element can be defined as any node in our Html document whereas Component can be specified as a part of our Application.
   We need components to work with elements in our project.

5.)A component in react can be Class Component (or) Functional Component.

   The syntax for creating class components is,
	class App extends Component{
		render(){
			return();
		}
	}

   The syntax for creating functional components is,
	function App(props){
		render(){
			return()}
	}
	export default App;

6.)When we are working with states, we have to use class component over functional component

7.)A pure component is defined as a component where the outcome will depend only on the arguments regarding the component.

8.)A state is defined as internal data in the component.

9.)A props is defined as data which is passed to another component.other component uses the data by props.attribute9or)props.method

10.)A state is internal definition/data of component whereas props is data coming from outside the component.
